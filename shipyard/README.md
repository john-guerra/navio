## Synopsis
The Navio Shipyard is a web application that eases the use of the Navio without programming. The Navio is a d3 visualization widget to helps summarizing, exploring and navigating large network visualizations.

## Motivation
The task of visualizing large multi-dimensional datasets is not trivial. It requires visualization design expertise to make a proper data exploration. In addition, as the data increases in size and dimensions, the task becomes more complex. Thus, to ease the exploration, summarization and visualization of large multi-dimensional datasets without losing the context of the data, John Alexis Guerra-Gómez developed Navio: a side visualization widget for aiding the navigation of network visualization. Nevertheless, to use this widget basic knowledge about programming , data processing and web development is crucial. For this reason, any user without the basic knowledge mentioned above would find useful a tool that allows them to upload, pre-process and visualize large multi-dimensional datasets using the Node Navigator.

## Installation
